| Feature              | Endpoint                     | Middleware                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| User Login           | `/auth/login`                | ErrorHandler                             |
| User Signup          | `/auth/signup`               | ErrorHandler                             |
| Create Product       | `/products/createproduct`    | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| Delete Product       | `/products/:id`              | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| Get Product by ID    | `/products/:id`              | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
| List Products        | `/products/`                 | AuthMiddleware, AdminMiddleware, ErrorHandler |
